1. Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

2. The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single Redux store.

3. The only way to change the STATE is to emit an ACTION, an object describing what happend.

4. To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.
 - The Store and the Reducer are great buddies. Always in sync.
 - The REDUCER always “talks” to the STORE.
 - The Reducer is the only mandatory argument passed into createStore()

5. An ACTION must have a type field. This field describes the intent of the action.
  - Action Creators are simply functions that help you create actions. They are functions that return action objects.
